# About Me
Hi, I'm currently an Clinical Analyst at Cochlear in Sydney and have recently completed a double degree in commerce (marketing analytics) and cognitive neuroscience. 
My skills and interests are wide-ranging, and my goal is to continue to apply a blend of technical skill with domain knowledge to design and deliver increasingly better quality solutions to increasingly more complex and meaningful challenges.

For my full list of experience, please feel free to get in touch: www.linkedin/in/gabriel-katzeff.
